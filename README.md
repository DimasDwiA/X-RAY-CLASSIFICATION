# X-RAY-CLASSIFICATION
## Introduction
X-rays are a type of electromagnetic wave radiation. X-ray imaging will create images of the inside of the body. These images will show the body parts in various shades of black and white. These black and white images are produced because the tissues of the body absorb different amounts of radiation. For example, calcium in the body absorbs the most X-rays, so bones appear white. While fat and other soft tissues absorb less, so they appear gray. The X-ray procedure is quick and painless. X-ray examinations aim to help doctors diagnose and monitor several conditions of the body. For example, complaints such as infections, tooth decay, fractures, arthritis, osteoporosis, or bone cancer. 

As an AI enthusiast, I take and collect X-ray data to help and make it easier for doctors and nurses to classify what type of disease the patient has, for that I build a model that can make it easier for doctors and nurses to diagnose the patient's disease to be followed up (prevent or treat the patient).
